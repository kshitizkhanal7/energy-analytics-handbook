# Handbook of Energy Analytics
_Techno-economic energy systems modeling and analysis using data-centric and algorithmic approaches_

*Kshitiz Khanal*

As the digitalization of our energy systems ramps up, making sense of those energy systems to accelerate the energy systems will increase the demand for modeling and analytical skills specific to energy systems. The analysts require domain knowledge in the physical, technical, social, and economic sides of the energy systems as well as analytical knowledge in data and algorithms.

While various software specializing in various aspects of modeling and analyzing energy systems are currently available, it is more important for analysts to learn how to approach a problem than to learn how to use specific software/tools. This handbook, through detailed worked-out examples, helps analysts learn how to model ad-hoc aspects of complex energy systems for common energy modeling tasks. Even though specific software/tools can be used, learning ad-hoc modeling helps develop analysts who are better prepared for the energy transition. 

This handbook covers lessons and tutorials on applications of modeling, optimization, data science, machine learning, spatial analysis, and other techniques. The resources are demonstrated primarily in Python, with some developed in R, Excel, and other tools best fit for the purpose.
